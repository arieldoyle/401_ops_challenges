# Script: Ops 401 Class 31 Ops Challenge Solution
# Author: Ariel D.                  
# Date of latest revision: 14NOV2022      
# Purpose: 
    # Prompt the user to type in a file name to search for.
    # Prompt the user for a directory to search in.
    # Search each file in the directory by name.
        # TIP: You may need to perform different commands depending on what OS youâ€™re executing the script on.
    # For each positive detection, print to the screen the file name and location.
    # At the end of the search process, print to the screen how many files were searched and how many hits were found.
    # The script must successfully execute on both Ubuntu Linux 20.04 Focal Fossa and Windows 10.
